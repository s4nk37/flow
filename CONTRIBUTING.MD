## 📏 Naming Conventions

We follow strict naming conventions to keep the codebase clean.

*   **Branches:**
    *   `feat/` - New features
    *   `fix/` - Bug fixes
    *   `hotfix/` - Critical fixes for production
    *   `chore/` - Maintenance tasks
    *   `docs/` - Documentation updates
    *   `refactor/` - Code refactoring
*   **Code:**
    *   Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `TodoRepository`)
    *   Variables/Functions: `camelCase` (e.g., `getTodos`)
    *   Files: `snake_case` (e.g., `todo_repository.dart`)

## 🎨 Code Style

We enforce a strict style guide using `flutter_lints` and custom rules in `analysis_options.yaml`.

*   **Colors:** Always use `AppColors` from the theme. Do not hardcode hex values.
*   **Text:** Use `AppTextStyles` for consistent typography.
*   **Responsiveness:** Use our `Responsive` utility or `SizeConfig` for adaptive layouts.
*   **Assets:** Access images and icons via the `Assets` class generated by the toolkit.

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

Found a bug? Have a feature request? Please use the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/s4nk37/flow/issues).

*   **Bugs:** Describe the issue, steps to reproduce, and expected behavior.
*   **Features:** Explain the "why" and "what" of the proposed feature.
